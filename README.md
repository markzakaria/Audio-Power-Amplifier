# Audio-Power-Amplifier
This project aims to build an audio power amplifier system to boost the volume of sounds within the human hearing range (between 20 Hz (very low bass) and 20 kHz (very high treble)), The project demonstrates how  modifying resistance and capacitance in the circuit influences the sound heard from the speaker.
